# Pilot Episode Summary

The episode begins in the morning with a shot of Ted Lawson leaving work while carrying a medium sized case. Cut to the kitchen, where Joan and their son Jamie Lawson are talking. Joan encourages Jamie to ask his dad if he will do something with him, when Ted storms through the door and answers that he won't be doing anything with Jamie. He hurries into the living room carrying his mysterious beige case. Jame and Joan follow him.

Up in Ted and Joan's bedroom, Ted reveals the contents of the case: body parts for a doll-like robot. It's a part of an experiment he has been working on at work but it hasn't been going well. He says that he wants to continue working on it, and Joan says that it's okay with her.
Cut to Ted working on a now assembled and dressed Vicki. He runs a final series of tests using his computer: he orders her to blink, wiggle her nose, and then to speak. Satisfied, he disconnects her from the computer.

In the kitchen, he introduces Vicki to his family. Joan is beside herself, dropping her cookie sheet out of surprise.

The next morning, Jamie wakes up Vicki and instructs her to deliver breakfast in bed in honor of his parents' wedding anniversary. Things do not go well when Vicki takes his instructions too literally and throws the tray full of food at his parents.

Upset because he has gotten in trouble, Jamie thinks out loud to himself that he needs to do something big in order to impress his parents. He sneaks out of the house and over to the local shopping mall. But, Vicki has followed him and accidentally gets locked in a storage closet. Jame panics but Vicki uses her strength to bust out.

The two kids sneak back into the kitchen thinking they've made it back scott-free, but their parents are waiting for them.
